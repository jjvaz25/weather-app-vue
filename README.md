# weather-app-vue
A simple weather app where the user enters in information on a city and will be presented with the weather report. Uses OpenWeatherMap API

The user must enter a zipcode in order for the API to correctly fetch. I could impliment a different API that would
allow the user to also enter a city by swapping out the link in the source code.
